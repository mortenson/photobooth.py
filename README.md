# photobooth.py

Given the complexity of existing photobooth software, and how much I enjoy
classic photobooths, I decided to script up something that simple takes four
pictures on a timer and adds them to a strip.

# Requirements

- Python 2.7+
- numpy 1.11.0+ (Python package)
- Pillow 3.2.0+ (Python package)
- OpenCV 3.0.0+ (Python package)

# Use

Simply run "python photobooth.py" to start your photobooth.
